# uMeet
A mobile/web based game used to encourage interaction between randomly chosen people by giving them a question to ask the other person within a certain timeframe.

## Summary
This project is to create an "ice breaker", pointing type game that encourages interaction between pairs of people. You will be randomly assigned a person to meet and given a question to ask them once you find each other.
This game is intended to encourage interaction between people who don't know each others.
A leaderboard will also be present, giving you points after you've successfully interacted with someone.
